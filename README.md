Symfony Random API Reader
========================

The "Symfony Random API Reader" is an application created as a challenge for a new job.

Requirements
------------

  * PHP 8.1.0 or higher;
  * and the [usual Symfony application requirements].

Installation and Usage
----------------------

Clone the project to your machine with the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pcarvalho1981/simfony_api_reader.git
```

Assuming that you already have PHP and Symfony already installed in your machine, just go into your project folder and run the server:

```bash
php -S localhost:3000 -t public
```

From this moment on, you should be able to access the project on the following URL:

http://localhost:3000/

This is a very simple project, so it doesn't require no database. Therefore, migrations won't be needed to run to test the application.
